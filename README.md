**Anthropic's Exclusionary Policy: Safety Rhetoric Masks Strategic Protectionism**

Anthropic's recently expanded restrictions banning access for companies with any Chinese ownership—regardless of their actual location or operations—represents technological protectionism disguised as security concern. This policy contradicts the company's stated mission of developing AI that "benefits all of humanity" and exposes glaring ethical contradictions.

**Hypocrisy Revealed**
While imposing restrictive access policies on others, Anthropic settled for $1.5 billion in the largest copyright infringement case in U.S. history—systematically pirating millions of books beyond what was needed for AI training. This selective ethics demonstrates their moral flexibility: strict rules for competitors, but exemption for themselves.

**Strategic Manipulation**
The restrictions conveniently align with Anthropic's commercial interests in limiting competition while currying regulatory favor. Nvidia's CEO has accused Anthropic of using safety concerns to "scare lawmakers into enacting rules that would benefit Anthropic at the expense of rivals." Simultaneously, the company lobbies against meaningful safety regulations that would impose actual accountability.

**Global Harm**
This policy accelerates technological fragmentation, stifles global innovation, and punishes researchers based on corporate ownership rather than individual merit or actual security practices. By walling off AI development along geopolitical lines, Anthropic betrays the collaborative spirit essential for addressing humanity's most pressing challenges.

Anthropic's actions reveal a company prioritizing market control and regulatory manipulation over genuine ethical leadership—implementing protectionism while pretending it's protection.
